# asos-product-database
It creates a particular data-base for existing website

Overview
This repository contains the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and database schema for an e-commerce platform inspired by ASOS.com. The database is designed to handle product catalogs, inventory management, and various product attributes for a fashion retail website.
Database Structure
Core Entities
1. Product Management

product: Main product information including basic details, pricing, and descriptions
product_item: Specific variations of products with different colors and seasonal attributes
product_variation: Individual SKUs combining product items with size options and stock quantities

2. Categorization & Organization

product_category: Hierarchical product categories with parent-child relationships
brand: Brand information and descriptions
colour: Color definitions for product variations

3. Size & Fit Management

size_category: Different sizing systems (e.g., UK, EU, US sizes)
size_option: Specific size options within each category
body_fit: Fit types (e.g., slim, regular, loose)

4. Product Attributes

neckline: Neckline styles for clothing items
sleeve_length: Sleeve length options
length: Product length specifications
style: Style categories and types
season: Seasonal collections
dress_name: Specific dress style names

5. Media Management

product_image: Product photography and visual assets

Key Relationships
Product Hierarchy
product (1) → (M) product_item (1) → (M) product_variation

One product can have multiple items (different colors/attributes)
One product item can have multiple variations (different sizes)

Categorization
product_category (1) → (M) product_category (self-referencing for hierarchy)
product_category (1) → (M) product
brand (1) → (M) product
Sizing System
size_category (1) → (M) size_option (1) → (M) product_variation
size_category (1) → (M) product
Product Attributes
Multiple attribute tables (1) → (M) product_item
Including: neckline, sleeve_length, length, style, season, body_fit, dress_name
Media Management
product (1) → (M) product_image

Usage Notes
Stock Management
Stock quantities are tracked in the product_variation table using the quality_in_stock field (note: appears to be a typo for "quantity_in_stock").
Pricing Strategy
The schema supports both original and sales pricing at multiple levels:

Product level: Base pricing
Product item level: Variant-specific pricing

Image Management
Product images are linked to specific product items, allowing for color-specific photography.
Technical Considerations
Indexing Recommendations

Primary keys are automatically indexed
Consider indexing foreign keys for better join performance
Index frequently queried fields like product_name, brand_name

Data Integrity

Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
Consider adding check constraints for price validation (sales_price ≤ original_price)

Future Enhancements

Customer reviews and ratings
Wishlist functionality
Order management system
User accounts and authentication
Shopping cart functionality
Payment processing integration

Database Technology
This schema is designed to be compatible with major relational database systems including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

This database schema provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive e-commerce platform with robust product management and inventory tracking capabilities.
